<p>Treaty with Lagos, 1861.
Treaty between Norman B. Bedingfield,
Commander of Her Majesty's ship Prometheus, and Senior Officer of the Bights
Division, and William McCoskry, Esquire,
Her Britannic Majesty's Acting Consul, on
the part of Her Majesty the Queen of Great
Britain, and Docemo, King of Lagos, on the
part of himself and Chiefs.</p>
</div2>
<div2 type="article">
<head type="sub">ARTICLE I</head>
<p>In order that the Queen of England may
be the better enabled to assist, defend, and
protect the inhabitants of Lagos, and to put
an end to the Slave Trade in this and the
neighbouring countries, and to prevent the
destructive wars so frequently undertaken by
Dahomey and others for the capture of slaves,
I, Docemo, do, with the consent and advice
of my Council, give, transfer, and by these
presents grant and confirm unto the Queen
of Great Britain, her heirs and successors for
ever, the port and Island of Lagos, with all
the rights, profits, territories, and appurtenances whatsoever thereunto belonging and as
well the profits and revenue as the direct, full,
and absolute dominion and sovereignty of
the said port, island and premises, with all
the royalties thereof, freely, fully entirely, and
absolutely. I do also covenant and grant that
the quiet and peaceable possession thereof
shall, with all possible speed, be freely and
effectually delivered to the Queen of Great
Britain, or such person as Her Majesty shall
thereunto appoint for her use in the performance of this grant; the inhabitants of the
said island and territories, as the Queen's
subjects, and under her sovereignty, Crown,
jurisdiction,   and   government,   being   still
suffered to live there.</p>
</div2>
<div2 type="article">
<head type="sub">ARTICLE II</head>
<p>Docemo will be allowed the use of the
title of King in its usual African signification,
and will be permitted to decide disputes
between natives of Lagos with their consent,
subject to appeal to British laws.</p>
</div2>
<pb facs="ardhi.treaty.00001.002"/>
<div2 type="article">
<head>ARTICLE III</head>
<p>In the transfer of lands,
the stamp of Docemo affixed
to the document will be
proofs that there are no
other native claims upon it,
and for this purpose he will
be permitted to use it as
hitherto.</p>
<p>In consideration of the
cession as before-mentioned
of the port and island and
territories of Lagos, the Representatives of the Queen of
Great Britain do promise,
subject to the approval of
Her Majesty, that Docemo
shall receive an annual pension from the Queen of
Great Britain equal to the
net revenue hitherto annually received by him; such
pension to be paid at such
periods and in such mode as
may hereafter be determined</p>
