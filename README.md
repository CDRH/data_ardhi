## About Ardhi Initiative

Because land grabs and resource-based conflicts are common and recurrent, land inequality crosses multiple knowledge areas: human geography, agriculture, political economy, sociology, and anthropology. The Ardhi Initiative will use Digital Humanities (DH) methodologies to identify connections and patterns that emerge across the African continent over a 100-year period. The long-term goal of this research is to ascertain varied continent-wide approaches that sustainably resolve land inequality. In the short term, the purview of this project is to investigate the 1850-1960 history of African land acquisitions, increasing the chances of re-discovering home-grown solutions. The following are objectives of the Ardhi Initiative:

- digitize and encode (XML) 40 sovereignty treaties between European nations and African political entities
- curate encoded documents online for use by other scholars
- perform Natural Language Processing on encoded data
- determine patterns of rhetoric regarding land use
- produce data visualizations and publicly disseminate my research findings
