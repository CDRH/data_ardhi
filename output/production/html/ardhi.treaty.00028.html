Chief Gungunhana.</em></span>
<p class="tei_p">ON the 29th December, 1890, near "Chigocho" belonging to the Chief Gungunhana,
at Violante, at 11 A.M., there being present the said Chief and his chief Indunas, as well as
the Superintendent-in-chief of Native Affairs in Gazaland, Councillor Jozé Joaquim
d’Almeida; the Superintendent of Mussunge, Arthur Antonio Matheus Serrano; the
Superintendent or the Upper Savi, Adrião Miguel Xavier; the Vice-Superintendent of
Inhaoxe, Ricardo Carneiro de Souza e Faro ; the Ensigns in the Portuguese Army, Antonio
Moreira de Souza, Jozé Augusto de Quadros, and Manuel de Jesus Barreira; the Russian
subject, Maurice Torbeau Breterman; the British subject, Alexander Deans; the interpreters, 
Quelimane and Victorino; as well as myself, Ignacio de Paiva Rdposo, Superintendent 
of Bilene, Acting Secretary to the expedition to Gazaland :</p>
<p class="tei_p">There and then appeared, as summoned by the powerful Vatua Potentate, the following
Englishmen: Aurel Schultz, Frank Colquhoun, G. Mackillican, M. A. Barnett, Fels,
and his wife, who have for some time past been encamped in these lands; in whose
presence the aforesaid Potentate was desirous to make of his own free will, as he said, a few
declarations which he looked upon as indispensable, although the same would be merely a
repetition of other similar declarations which he had at various times and at different times
made ("subsequentemente") in succession.</p>
<p class="tei_p">On taking their places, his Excellency the Superintendent-in-chief remained at the
right hand of the Chief, and then after him all the Superintendent’s officials, and then
Messrs. Breterman and Deans. The Indunas were placed to the left of Gungunhana,
who caused Mr. Colquhoun and his companions to take their seats in front of him, quite
apart from the Portuguese and Vatuas. After the assembly had thus been formed, the
Chief was requested by his Excellency the Superintendent-in-chief to deliver his speech,
and to state what he had to say, which he did, and explained that his object was to make
it quite public, in the face of the foreigners who were present, that he and his people, as
well as his grandfather, Manecusse, and his father, Muzila, were the faithful and submissive 
vassals of His Majesty the King of Portugal, and that whatever statements might
be made, and. whatever intrigues might be carried on, the region of Gazaland would be
Portuguese as long as he lived, and he was its Governor. That the flag which they all
saw hoisted near his house would never be replaced by that of any other nation, and that
the promise which he made was so sincere that, in order that his sons should respect that
promise, he had delivered them to the Secretary (the Superintendent-in-chief), together
with some other children, who would in future be the magnates of the country, for the
purpose of receiving their educaton in Portugal, and learning there the language and
customs of the nation to which they were to belong, and in order that they should be
thoroughly imbued with the affection, fidelity, and respect which they ought to profess
for that nation.</p>
<p class="tei_p">That he, as well as the whole "famine" family, who were the descendants of the
great Zulu Chiefs, adhered to his word ; and if there was in his heart the slightest inclination 
to accept the British flag, he would have the courage to so there and then in the
presence of the Portuguese, as he had the courage to say that he refused to accept it in
the presence of the English who were listening to him. That this matter should be
settled once for all, and that he requested the Secretary never again to entertain any
doubts as to his loyalty, because any such doubt was to him just as deep a source of pain
as that felt by an innocent and honest woman accused of unfaithfulness.</p>
<p class="tei_p">That it was true that many Englishmen, who all professed to be his friends, and gave
him presents of greater or less value, visited him, and some endeavoured to trade with
him in hides and ivory; others wished to obtain from him Concessions of auriferous soil;
and others, finally, tried to induce him to place himself under Great Britain; but it was
likewise certain that as regards the first named he merely confined himself to trading with
them, if it suited him; and he answered those named in the second place, among whom
Shiboquana (Mr. Colquhoun) there present, as well as Dr. Bertrand, who left this region
two months ago, were included, that it was only the King and the Secretary who could
attend to them. As regards the last named, he invariably replied that he wished his
corpse to be wrapped up in a flag similar to that in which the body of his mother, the
venerable Uzio, was buried.</p>
<p class="tei_p">That he had already said, and he now repeated it, that some time ago he had sent
Guro-Guio to Katal; when seeing himself abandoned by the residents, and threatened by
Inhambane and Lourenço Marques, he thought he had forfeited the esteem of His
Majesty, and that Portugal wanted to wage war against him because he had defeated
Binguana; but that now, as he had then, he declared that the emissary had not been
charged to say anything that might compromise his nationality as a Portuguese. That he
wanted to, know whether anything was known there as to our proposing to wage war
against him, and, if so, to ask the English to interfere with the King on his behalf. He
reverted to the subject at the present moment because the Englishman Bube (Mr. Aurel
Schultz) was present, who had come on the part of the Government of Natal to ascertain
what wap the state, of the relations now between him, Gunganhana, and Portugal, and to
bring him a "saguate," and he defied him on this occarion to contradict him.</p>
<p class="tei_p">That these were the only declarations which he wished to make publicly known, and
he felt a relief at having made them, and he had nothing further to say.</p>
<p class="tei_p">His Excellency the Councillor and Superintendent-in-chief then spoke, and asked
Gungunhana to declare before every one to whom Chissambobuco ("Chifambobsico"), the
son of the deceased Mutassa and Chief of Manica, belonged. The Chief Vatua answered
this request by saying that every one was aware that Chifambobsico belonged to him ever
since the submission of Mutassa had been imposed upon him by force of arms; that there
could be no doubt concerning this matter, either on the part of the Secretary who had for
a long time his own people exploring mines and also a Portuguese authority, or on the
part of the English, inasmuch as they are daily applying to him for Concessions in that
territory.</p>
<p class="tei_p">The region in question could not but belong to him, Considering that his dominion
extends as far as Dumas (Mashona) and reaches Motoco. Moreovers, Manica has ever had
since its conquest a Vatua Governor; Maguiguana in the time of Manecuse and Muzila,
and now Michava; and as the latter was how at Violante he would summon him to present
himself before us.</p>
<p class="tei_p">Oh his Excellency the Councillor inquiring whether the Chief had regularly received
the taxes due from Manica, he replied in the affirmative and said that the last oxen which
he brought frorh that place as a tribute had only arrived about two months ago and were
now grazing in the lands Chopes of Malache, at a short distance from this place.</p>
<p class="tei_p">A quarter of an hour afterwards Michava made his appearance and was introduced by
Gungunhana to all the persons present. After this, the Superintendent-in-chief said that
he trusted in the loyalty of Gungunhana and that he was glad to have heard him to speak,
but the foreigners who came to visit him tried on the coast to make him out to be not very
truthful and a bad Portuguese.</p>
<p class="tei_p">This was no vague assertion, because in the presence of them all he accused
Mr. Colquhoun, who was present, of having at Lourenço Marque's stated to the
Superintendent, Ignacio de Paiva Raposo; that the fact of our flag being hoisted here
did not mean anything, inasmuch as Gungunhana had told him that he; Mr. Colquhoun,
might also hoist his own. That Mr. Brettermann had also been informed by Mr. Colquhoun 
in the same city that the Indunas had offered him their children to be educated in
England, and that one of the Indunas wanted to become an Englishman.</p>
<p class="tei_p">The Chief and Indunas replied that all this was untrue, and told Mr. Colquhoun to
present his defence in case the charges brought against him to his face were not true; but
he merely declared that in point of fact Messrs. Brettermann and Raposo spoke the truth,
and that it was he who had not spoken the truth, because he was drunk when he had that
conversation with them.</p>
<p class="tei_p">At Gungunhana's request, the Councillor and Superintendent-in-chief then inquired
from Mr. Colquhoun whether he obtained any Concession from the Vatuas. The person
questioned, however, refused to answer, although, his Excellency warned him that inasmuch
as at that place the authority of Portugal was, quite legitimate and recognized, he was
questioning him officially and that he well knew what it was his duty to do in order to get
the wished-for answer.</p>
<p class="tei_p">It being 3 P.M., the meeting was declared to be at an end; of the proceedings of which
the present Minute or Record has been drawn up, which is about to be signed by the
Councillor and Superintendent-in-chief, by the other officials, by Messrs. Brettermann and
Deans, and by me, Ignacio de Paiva Raposo, Superintendent of Bilene, Acting Secretary,
who wrote it out and signed it.</p>
