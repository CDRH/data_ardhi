the course of the River Rovuma from its
niouth up to the confluence of the River
M’Sinje, and thence westerly along the
parallel of latitude to the shore of Lake
Nyassa.
2. To the west by a line which, starting
from the above-mentioned frontier on Lake
Nyassa, follows the eastern shore of the lake

line to the easternmost affluent of the River
Ruo, and thence follows that affluent, and
subsequently, the centre of the channel of
the Ruo to its confluence with the River
Shird. From thence it runs in a direct line
to a point half-way between Tété and the
Kabra-bassa Rapids.

extremity of the lO-mile radius of Zumbo,
runs directly southwards as far as the 16th
parallel ofsouth latitude, follows that parallel
to its intersection with the 31st degree of
east longitude (Greenwich , thence running
eastward direct to the point where the River
Mazoe is intersected oy the 33rd degree of
east longitude; it follows that degree southwards to its intersection by the 18° 30'
parallel of south latitude; runs along that
parallel westward to the affluent of the River
Save or Sabi, which is called the River
Masheke; follows that affluent, and afterwards the centre of the main channel of the

other Power without the previous consent
of Great Britain.
ARTICLE III.
Great Britain engages not to make any
objection to the extension of the sphere of

Portugal engages that the territory of
which the limits are defined in this Article
shall not, without the consent of Great
Britain, be transferred to any other Power.

centre of the channel of the Kabompo.
The country hereby recognized as Portuguese shall not, without the consent of Great
Britain, be transferred to any other Power.

regards transport or coasting-trade; goods,
of whatever origin, shall be subject to no
dues except those, not differential in their
incidence, which may be levied for objects

interest of trade; no transit-dues shall be
permitted, and no monopoly or favour in

provisions of the preceding paragraph, her
ports on the East Coast. She also reserves
the right to exclude from the operation of
the provisions of the preceding paragraph
her ports on the West Coast.
She engages, however, not to charge
transit-dues exceeding a maximum of 3 per
cent, OQ goods passing in transit inwards or
outwards between the coast and the British
sphere of inhuence, either by land or water.
These dues shall in no case have a differential character, and shall not exceed the
customs dues levied on the same goods at
the above-mentioned ports.
It is understood that, under the terms of
this Article, there shall be freedom for the
passage of subjects and goods of both
Powers across the Zambesi, and through the
districts adjoining the river for the purpose
of such passage, along its whole course,
without hindrance of any description and
without payment of transit-dues.
It is further understood that within a
zone of 20 English miles on the north bank
of the Zambesi Portugal shall have the right
to construct roads, railways, bridges, and
telegraph-lines across the territories reserved
to British influence on the north of the
Zambesi. Both Powers shall have the same
right within a zone of 10 English miles on
the south of the Zambesi between Tété and
the confluence or the Chobe, and within a
zone of the same dimensions running from
the north-east of the British sphere south of
the Zambesi to the above-mentioned zone.
The two Powers shall have the power, in
these zones, of acquiring, on reasonable conditions, the land necessary for such objects,
and shall receive all other requisite facilities.
They shall also be allowed facilities for the
construction on the river, between the above-named limits, of piers and landing-places
for
the purpose of trade or navigation. All
materials for the construction of roads, railways, bridges, and telegraph-lines shall
be
admitted free of charge.
Differences of opinion between the two
Governments as to the execution of their
respective obligations, incurred in accordance
with the provisions of the preceding paragraph, shall be referred to the arbitration
of two experts, one of whom shall be chosen
on behalf of each Power, who shall select an
Umpire, whose decision, in case of difference
between the Arbitrators, shall be final. If
the two experts cannot agree upon the
choice of an Umpire, this Umpire shall be
selected by a neutral Power.
ARTICLE XII.
The navigation of the Zarabesi and Shiré,
without excepting any of their branches and
outlets, shall be entirely free for the ships of
all nations.
ARTICLE XIII.
Merchant-ships of the two Powers shall
in the Zambesi, its branches and outlets,
have equal freedom of navigation, whether
with cargo or ballast, for the transportation
of goods and passengers. In the exercise
of this navigation the subjects and flags of
both Powers shall be treated, in all circumstances, on a footing of perfect equality,
not
only for the direct navigation from ihe open
sea to the inland ports of the Zambesi, and
vice versa, but for the great and small
coasting trade, and for boat trade on the
course of the river. Consequently, on all
the course and mouths of the Zambesi there
will be no differential treatment of the subjects of the two Powers; and no exclusive
privilege of navigation will be conceded by
either to Companies, Corporations, or private
persons.
I'he navigation of the Zambesi shall not
be subject to any restriction or obligation
based merely on the fact of navigation. It
shall not be exposed to any obligation in
regard to landing-station or depôt, or for
breaking bulk, or for compulsory entry into
port. In all the extent of the Zambesi the
ships and goods in process of transit on the
river shall be submitted to no transit dues,
whatever their starting-place or destination.
No maritime or river toll shall be levied
based on the sole fact of navigation, nor any
tax on goods on board of ships. There
shall only be collected taxes or duties which
shall be an equivalent for services rendered
to navigation itself. The Tariff of these
taxes or duties shall not warrant any differential treatment.
The affluents of the Zambesi shall be in
all respects subject to the same rules as the
river of which they are tributaries.
The roads, paths, railways, or lateral
canals which may be constructed with the
special object of obviating the innavigability
or correcting the imperfections of the river
route on certain sections of the course of
the Zambesi, its affluents, branches, and
outlets, shall be considered, in their quality
of means of communication, as dependencies
of this river, and as equally open to the
traffic of both Powers. And, as on the river
itself, so there shall be collected on these
roads, railways, and canals only tolls calculated on the cost of construction, maintenance,
and management, and on the profits
due to the promoters. As regards the
Tariff of these tolls, strangers and the
natives of the respective territories shall be
treated on a footing of perfect equality.
Portugal undertakes to apply the principles of freedom of navigation enunciated in
this Article on so much of the waters of the
Zambesi, its affluents, branches, and outlets,
as are or may be under her sovereignty,
protection, or influence. The rules which
she may establish for the safety and control
of navigation shall be drawn up in a way to
facilitate, as far as possible, the circulation
of merchant-ships.
Great Britain accepts, under the same
reservations, and in identical terms, the
obligations undertaken in the preceding
Articles in respect of so much ofthe waters
of the Zambesi, its affluents, branches, and
outlets, as are or may be under her sovereignty, protection, or influence.
Any questions arising out of the provisions of this Article shall be referred to a
Joint Commission, and, in case of disagreement, to arbitration.
Another system for the administration
and control of the Zambesi may be substituted for the above arrangements by
common consent of the Riverain Powers.
Portugal will, on application from Great
Britain, grant to a Company a lease for
100 years of 10 acres at the mouth of the
Chindé, for purposes of transhipment. The
ground so leased shall not in ariv case be
fortified.
ARTICLE XIV.
In the interest of both Powers, Portugal
agrees to grant absolute freedom of passage
between the British sphere of influence and
Pungwd Bay for merchandize of every
description, and to give the necessary facilities for the improvement of the means
of
communication. She undertakes to construct a railway to serve this region within
a jperiod fixed by surveys which shall be
completed with the least possible delay.
An engineer named by the British Government
shall take part in these surveys, which
shall commence within a period of four
months from the signature of this Convention. In case these conditions should not
be precisely carried out, Portugal will grant
to a Joint Company under the control of
Portuguese and British Directors, and with
seats in Lisbon and London, with the least
possible delay, a Concession for the construction of a Railway, with all requisite
facilities for the acquisition of land, cutting
timber, and free importation and supply of
materials and labour.
It is understood that no dues shall be
levied at the port of entry or exit on goods
in transit exceeding the maximum of 3 per
cent. under the conditions stipulated in
Article XI.
It is further understood that the same
provision as to goods in transit applies to
the Limpopo, the Save, and all other navigable rivers flowing to the coast of the
Portuguese spheres in East or West Africa,
with the exception of the Zambesi.
ARTICLE XV.
Great Britain and Portugal engage to
facilitate telegraphic communication in their
respective spheres.
The stipulations contained in Article XIV
as regards the construction of a railway
from Pungwé Bay to the interior shall be
applicable in all respects to the construction
of a telegraph-line for communication between the coast and the British sphere south
of the Zambesi. Questions as to the points
of departure and termination of the line,
and as to other details, if not arranged by
common consent shall be submitted to the
arbitration of experts under the prescribed
conditions.
Portugal engages to maintain telegraphic
service between the coast and the River
Ruo, which shall be open to the use of the
subjects of the two Powers without any
differential treatment.
Great Britain and Portugal engage to give
every facility for the connection of telegraphic lines constructed in their respective
spheres.
Details in respect to such connection, and
in respect to questions relating to the settlement of through tariffs and other charges,
shall, if not settled by common consent, be
referred to the arbitration of experts under
the prescribed conditions.
ARTICLE XVI.
All differences not specifically mentioned
in the preceding Articles which may arise
between the two Governments with regard
to this Convention shall be submitted to
arbitration.
ARTICLE XVII.
The present Convention shall be ratified,
and the ratifications shall be exchanged at
London as soon as possible.
In witness whereof the respective Plenipotentiaries have signed the present Convention,
and have affixed thereto the seal of
their arms.

day of August, in the year of Our Lord one
thousand eight hundred and ninety.
