Extract from the " Diario do Governo " of November 9, 1889.
(Translation.)
WHEREAS it is a matter of great importance to the interests of the Portuguese nation
to consolidate the dominion and sovereignty which it already holds in the interior
of the African Continent, and to cause it to irradiate to the various points where
its influence preponderates in such a manner as to secure the greatest success for
the great work of humanity—the civilization of Africa, in which this country has long
been engaged;
Whereas it is necessary for this purpose to establish certain strongholds and centres
of official action in order to afford to lawful trade such protection as it may require
for its development, and at the same time to oppose certain Slave Trade and slavery
practices that are still prevalent among the pagan and barbarous tribes of the wilds
in the interior;
Whereas the ancient village of Zumbo, on the left bank of Zambesi, naturally presents
itself as an appropriate place for the seat of a new district in the Province of Mozambique,
in view not only of the mildness of its climate and the fertility and richness of
the territories which surround it, but also by the extensive network of navigable
rivers of which it is the centre, such as the Upper Zambesi and its great affluents
the Cafucué and North Aruangua;
In view of the representations made to me upon this matter by the Governor-General
of the said province;
With the advice of the Board for the Colonies and the Council of Ministers;
Availing myself of the powers granted to the Government in the first paragraph of
the 15th Article of the First Additional Act to the Constitutional Charter of the
Monarchy;
I hereby decree:
Article 1. A new district is established in the Province of Mozambique under the name
Zumbo, its capital being the village of the same name.
Art. 2. The new district of Zumbo—which is in virtue of this Decree separated from
Tete—is bounded by the course of the Rivers Bissombo and North Aruangua from the point
of confluence of the first named river as far as the nearest point to the Cabeceiras
do Luangua along the course of this river till the Zambesi, and from the Zambesi until
the spot where it is joined by the River Mussengueji; thenceforward the frontier of
the new district is formed by the said River Mussengueji as far as its source along
the line of division formed by the waters of the Rivers Panhame and Luia and by the
bed of the Mazura until it meets the frontier of the district of Manica, coinciding
with the same as far as the point in which the Mazura meet the River Save; it then
follows the bed of this river on the upper side, and it thence proceeds to Cabeceiras
do Monfuli, alongside the bed of the latter as well as that of the Sanhati as far
as the Zambesi through which it continues to the westward.
