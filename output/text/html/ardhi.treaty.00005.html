1.   It is agreed that there shall henceforth be peace and friendship between the
British Colony of Sierra Leone and King Firama and King Tom, and all the
Princes, Headmen, and people subject.


2.  King Firama and King Tom, with the consent of all the Headmen at this time
assembled, do hereby surrender to His Majesty the King of Great Britain,

to
the possession of Cape Sierra Leone and the adjacent land, shall not be altered 
or affected by this Treaty; neither shall the claims of any other person
or persons to the same or any part thereof be affected or altered by it; but all
such claims shall remain the same as if this Treaty never had been made.


4.   No native town shall be built nearer to the Colony than Robiss, except
Robiss, Salt Town, and Ro-Cupra; the land between Robin and Ro-Cupra
shall be left to the people of those places for their luggars; and in consideration

of the permission thus given to rebuild Ro-Cupra, The Governor of
Sierra Leone shall have the right to make what use he thinks proper of Sig.

compensation to Sig. Domingo for the same.

upon between him and the Governor of Sierra Leone on the 7 March 1794,
shall continue to be paid to him.

in St. George's Bay shall be collected regularly and paid to King Firama
and his successors, or to such person as he or they may appoint to receive
the same.


7.  And to prevent disputes it is hereby acknowledged that the duties payable
for water are fifteen bars (each bar being of the full value of three shillings
and four pence sterling, if paid in goods or specie) for every trading vessel
that takes water, whether it takes little or much except crafts belonging to
traders residing on the Coast of Africa, and vessels of any description belonging

to the Sierra Leone Company, or to the colonists of Sierra Leone,
or to the proprietor of Bance Island. And further, that no vessel ought to pay
for water more than once in one voyage, unless that voyage continue more
than a twelvemonth.


8.  If any dispute shall arise concerning the boundary between the Colony and
Robiss and Ro-Cupra, the Governor of Sierra Leone and the Headmen of
Robiss and Ro-Cupra shall meet and settle it in a friendly way.
