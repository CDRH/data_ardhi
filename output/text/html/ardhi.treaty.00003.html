Letter of Commodore Mayo to King of Lagos
Commodore Mayo Commander in Chief of the United States Naval
Forces on the West Coast of Africa, having arrived off this port, desires to
salute the King of Lagos.
The United States have for a long time maintained a Squadron on the
Coast of Africa, to protect the persons and property of American Citizens,
engaged in lawful commerce; and to arrest and bring to justice all persons
who may endeavour to prosecute the Slave trade under the cover of the
American Flag. The Commodore has heard with much satisfaction that the
King of Lagos has done all in his power to suppress the African Slave trade,
and that he affords every facility to vessels that come to his territory for the
purpose of lawful traffic. He would be much gratified by receiving from the
King and Chiefs of Lagos some formal and written assurance that Citizens
of the United States, may always trade freely with the people of Lagos in all
ports, places and rivers, within their territory; and some pledge that the King
and Chiefs will show no favor, and give no privilege to the Ships and traders
of other countries, which they do not show to those of the United States, and
that all Citizens of the United States shall, under all circumstances, be placed
upon the same footing with the Citizens of the most favored Nation.
1 Date of cession of port and island of Lagos to Great Britain.
